commands
========

IDs can be the number IDs or the folder that contains a course/exercise.
You don't need to provide IDs again if you use `set-exercise` and `set-course`.

    tmc init                                   # asks for server, username and password and saves them for future usage
    tmc list-courses                           # lists all courses
    tmc list-exercises [CourseID]              # lists all exercises from course ID
    tmc download-exercises [CourseID]          # downloads all exercises from course ID
    tmc update-exercises [CourseID]            # updates all exercises without overriding user code
    tmc submit-exercise [ExerciseID]           # submits a exercise for testing
    tmc test-exercise [ExerciseID]             # tests exercise locally

    tmc set-course [CourseID]                  # sets the default CourseID, so that you don't need to write it again
    tmc unset-course                           # resets the default CourseID

    tmc set-exercise ID                        # sets the default ExerciseID
    tmc unset-exercise                         # resets the default ExerciseID
    tmc next-exercise                          # goes to the next exercise
    tmc previous-exercise                      # goes to the previous exercise
